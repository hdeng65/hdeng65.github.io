            <p>For 19th-century Americans, the act of beautifying was frowned upon as 
                it was seen as immoral and unrespectable. The “painted woman” provoked 
                disgust and censure from the virtuous. Only stage actress and prostitutes, 
                it was generally agreed, that would enhance their face with artifice.

                <br><br>A lady of a higher social standing would pursue a “natural” pale look as 
                it would indicate a woman did not have to work outside, and was thus of high status. 
                They would use accessories like gloves and umbrellas to help protect her from the environment.

                <br>Many cosmetic products were aimed at achieving as pale a complexion as possible. 
                Cold cream, vanishing cream, lotion, etc. became a staple in the beauty rituals of 
                Victorian womten to provide that perfect “natural”  look.

            <p>The New Woman image was often positioned in opposition to the Victorian “True Woman”,

                concept that emphasized domesticity and submissiveness.
                <br><br>“New Woman” went out to the public as professional woman, earnest labor activist, 
                the free spirited outdoor girl and sexually assertive flapper, etc. The demand for 
                cosmetics increased and the act of beautifying was associated women’s social life and activity, 
                and independence from the ways of the past.

                <br>Representations of the political New Woman in the media, whether as a suffragist,

            </h1>
            <p><br>
                Drag is a gender-bending art form in which a person dresses in clothing and makeup meant to exaggerate a 
                specific gender identity, usually of the opposite sex.
                 <br><br>Drag has deep roots in Western culture, specifically in theatre when women weren’t permitted to 
                 perform on stage so men would play female roles. Drag performers were featured as far back as ancient Greece and carried on through Shakespearean times.  
             <br><br></p>
            <img src="images/card6group1.png" alt="suffragette-a">
            <p><br>
                <br>
                <br>Cross-dressing and drag performances existed as an underground culture for much of the 20th century, 
                and the visibility of drag queens increased alongside that of LGBT communities in the late 1960s.   
            <br><br>The Harlem Renaissance (1920-1935) was particularly influential to this process. Through dance, drag queens showed how gender is a performance – 
            they pretended to put on makeup or “beat face”, style their hair, and put on extravagant clothes. <br><br></p>
            <img src="images/card6group1.png" alt="suffragette-a">
            <p><br>
                <br>
                <br>In Cristy’s (2017) interviews with drag queens to understand their gender performance, the participants mentioned they attained social and political 
                visibility through drag, as drag helped them reach a larger audience when attempting to express social and 
                political issues and norms. One mentioned that “drag is a political tool”.   
            <br><br></p>
            <img src="images/card6group1.png" alt="suffragette-a">
            <p><br>The action of painting and applying makeup has been a critical way for drag performers to shape their subculture, and with that, challenge geneder roles. 
            Being queer disrupts heteronormative expectations, and drag is an extension of this disruption.
